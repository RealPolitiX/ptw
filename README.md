Python implementation of parametric time warping for nonlinear alignment of 1D signals



The implementation is based on the origin algorithm proposed by Paul Eilers in the following publication,

P. H. C. Eilers, "Parametric time warping", *Anal. Chem.* **76** 404 (2004). [link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac034800e)

with modifications to include fitting of higher order terms.
